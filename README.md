Homework for Module 11

The assignment for week 11 included web scraping and data analysis. I used the starter code in my Jupyter Notebook to scrape a Mars News Website using automated browsing with splinter, Chrome Dev Tools, and Beautiful Soup. In the first part I extracted titles and previews from the webpage and stored them in a Python dictionary. For the second part, I did the same, but I saved them to a Pandas DataFrame and analyzed the dataset to answer questions regarding the Mars data. I also plotted several charts, before exporting the DataFrame to a csv file.
